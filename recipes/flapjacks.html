            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p> These pancakes are not too thick, not too thin, but tender, light, buttery, and delicious.</p>
            <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 cups milk</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
            </ul>
            <ol><strong>Steps</strong>
                <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until no lumps remain. Add milk, eggs, and oil; whisk until batter is runny and smooth.</li>
                <li>Heat a nonstick griddle over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, ladle a generous 1/4 cup batter for each pancake onto the preheated grill and cook until bubbles appear, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook, pressing middle gently with the spatula, until bottom is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            </ol>
